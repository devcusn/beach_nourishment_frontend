# Coastal Engineering Beach Nourishment Application

## Overview

This application is built using Vite for React development. It provides several tools and features for coastal engineers to assess and design beach nourishment projects. 

## Features

1. **Closure Depth Calculation**
    - Calculates the closure depth of a beach profile based on user inputs.
2. **Erosion Calculation**
    - Estimates erosion rates and volumes for different beach segments.
3. **3D Beach Profile**
    - Generates and visualizes a 3D model of the beach profile.
4. **Location-based Weather Data**
    - Fetches and displays weather data specific to the project's location.
5. **Cost Estimation**
    - Provides cost estimates for various beach nourishment activities.
6. **Coast Design**
    - Tools for designing and planning coastal projects, including beach nourishment layouts.

## Feature Details

### Closure Depth Calculation
- Allows users to input parameters such as wave height, wave period, and sediment size to calculate the closure depth of the beach profile.

### Erosion Calculation
- Provides tools to estimate the rate and volume of erosion over time, helping to understand long-term coastal changes.

### 3D Beach Profile
- Uses input data to create a 3D visualization of the beach profile, aiding in better understanding and presentation of the coastal morphology.

### Location-based Weather Data
- Integrates with weather APIs to provide real-time weather data specific to the project location, assisting in making informed decisions.

### Cost Estimation
- Offers a breakdown of potential costs associated with beach nourishment projects, including materials, labor, and equipment.

### Coast Design
- Provides interactive tools for designing and planning coastal structures and nourishment projects, including simulations and impact assessments.
